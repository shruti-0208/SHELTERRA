Land Suitability Analysis for Safe Construction using AI and IoT
Problem Statement
Unstable land conditions pose a significant risk to construction projects, leading to structural failures, landslides, and property loss. Current risk assessment methods rely heavily on manual surveys, which are time-consuming, expensive, and lack real-time monitoring. There is a critical need for an automated system that can continuously monitor land conditions, provide risk predictions, and alert homeowners and planners to potential hazards.
Solution
This project integrates IoT-based real-time land monitoring with AI-driven risk assessment. Sensors will collect real-time environmental data, which will be processed by AI models to evaluate the risk of landslides and other geohazards. A web dashboard will provide visualization, alerts, and recommendations for safe construction. Future enhancements include drone-based LiDAR mapping for precise elevation data, blockchain integration for secure land records, and government collaboration for urban planning.
